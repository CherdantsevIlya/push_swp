## :memo: **About**

_This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting_.

### *Objectives*  
> + Sorting algorithms
> + Battery concept and handling elements
> + Algorithm implementation

### *Skills*
> + Unix
> + Rigor
> + Imperative programming
> + Algorithms & AI

## üöÄ **Description**

The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.

### ü¶ë **Game rules**

+ **sa** : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
+ **sb** : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
+ **ss** : sa and sb at the same time.
+ **pa** : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
+ **pb** : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
+ **ra** : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
+ **rb** : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
+ **rr** : ra and rb at the same time.
+ **rra** : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
+ **rrb** : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
+ **rrr** : rra and rrb at the same time.
